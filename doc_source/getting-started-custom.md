# Getting started with a Custom dataset group<a name="getting-started-custom"></a>

 This getting started guide shows you how to provide personalized movie recommendations for your users with a Custom dataset group and the User\-Personalization recipe\. The tutorial uses historical data that consists of 100,000 movie ratings on 9,700 movies from 600 users\.

To begin, complete the [Getting started prerequisites](gs-prerequisites.md) and then proceed to either [Getting started \(console\)](getting-started-console.md), [Getting started \(AWS CLI\)](getting-started-cli.md), [Getting started \(SDK for Python \(Boto3\)\)](getting-started-python.md), or [Getting started \(SDK for Java 2\.x\)](getting-started-java.md)\.

When you finish the getting started exercise, to avoid incurring unnecessary charges, follow the steps in [Cleaning up resources](gs-cleanup.md) to delete the resources you created\.
