# Domain datasets and schemas<a name="domain-datasets-and-schemas"></a>

 When you create a Domain dataset group, the domain you choose determines your dataset and schema requirements\. Each domain has a default schema for each dataset type\. 

When you create a dataset, you can either use the default schema or create a new one based on the default schema\. Use the default schema as a guide for what data to collect and import into each dataset type\. The following topics explain dataset and schema requirements for each domain\. 

For information on the types of data you can import into Amazon Personalize see [Types of data you can import into Amazon Personalize](data.md)\.

For information about general Amazon Personalize schema requirements, such as formatting requirements and available field data types, see [Datasets and schemas](how-it-works-dataset-schema.md)\. These requirements apply to all schemas, regardless of domain\.
