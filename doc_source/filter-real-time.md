# Filtering real\-time recommendations<a name="filter-real-time"></a>

You can filter real\-time recommendations with the Amazon Personalize console, AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\), or the AWS SDKs\.

 When you get personalized recommendations or similar items, you can specify a promotion in your request\. A *promotion* uses a filter to define additional business rules that apply to a configurable subset of recommended items\. For more information see [Promoting items in recommendations \(Custom dataset group\)](promoting-items.md)\.

## Filtering real\-time recommendations \(console\)<a name="filter-rt-console"></a>

To filter real\-time recommendations using the console, create a filter and then apply it to a recommendation request\. 

**Note**  
To filter recommendations using a filter with parameters and a campaign deployed before November 10, 2020, you must redeploy the campaign by using the [UpdateCampaign](API_UpdateCampaign.md) operation or create a new campaign\.

### Creating a filter \(console\)<a name="creating-filter-console"></a>

 To create a filter in the console, choose the dataset group that contains the campaign or recommender you want to use to get filtered recommendations\. Then provide a filter name and a filter expression\.

**To create a filter \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon Personalize console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/personalize/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/personalize/home) and sign into your account\. 

1. Choose the dataset group that contains the campaign or recommender that you want to use to get filtered recommendations\.

1. In the navigation page, choose **Filters** and then choose **Create new filter**\. The **Create filter** page displays\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/images/create-filter-page.png)

1. For **Filter name**, enter a name for your filter\. You will choose the filter by this name when you apply it to a recommendation request\.

1. For **Expression**, choose either **Build expression** or **Add expression manually** and build or insert your expression:
   + To use the expression builder, choose **Build expression**\. The expression builder provides structure, fields, and guidelines for building correctly formatted filter expressions\. For more information, see [Using the filter expression builder](#using-filter-expression-builder)\.
   +  To input your own expression, choose **Add expression manually**\. For more information, see [Filter expression elements](filter-expressions.md#filter-expression-elements)\. 

1. Choose **Finish**\. The filter's overview page shows the filter’s Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\), status, and full filter expression\. To delete the filter, choose **Delete**\. For information about finding and deleting filters after you have left the overview page, see [Deleting a filter \(console\)](#delete-filter-console)\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/images/filter-details-page.png)

### Applying a filter \(console\)<a name="apply-filter-console"></a>

 To apply a filter, on the **Test recommender** panel for the recommender \(Domain dataset group\) or **Test campaign results** panel for the campaign \(Custom dataset group\), choose the filter and enter any filter parameter values\. Then get recommendations for a user\. 

**Important**  
For filter expressions that use an `INCLUDE` element to include items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression\. For filters with expressions that use an `EXCLUDE` element to exclude items, you can omit the `filter-values`\. In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter recommendations\.

**To apply a filter \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon Personalize console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/personalize/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/personalize/home) and sign into your account\. 

1. Choose the dataset group that contains the campaign or recommender that you want to use to get filtered recommendations\.

1. Depending on your dataset group type, do either of the following:

   1. For a Domain dataset group, in the navigation pane choose **Recommenders**\.

   1. For a Custom dataset group, in the navigation pane choose **Custom resources** then **Campaigns**\.

1. On the **Recommenders** or **Campaigns** page, choose the target recommender or campaign\.

1. For comparison, start by getting recommendations for a user without applying a filter\. Under **Test recommender** / **Test campaign results**, enter the ID of a user that you want to get recommendations for, and choose **Get recommendations**\. A table containing the user’s top recommendations appears\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/images/Recommendations_no-filter.PNG)

1. From the **Filter name** menu, choose the filter that you created\. If your filter has any placeholder parameters, the associated fields for each parameter appear\.

1. If you're using a filter with placeholder parameters, for each parameter, enter the value to set the filter criteria\. To use multiple values for one parameter, separate each value with a comma\.

1. Using the same `User ID` as in the earlier step, choose **Get recommendations**\. The recommendations table appears\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/images/Recommendations_filter.png)

   If the user already bought a recommended item, the filter removes it from the recommendation list\. In this example, items 2657, 2985 were replaced by the most suitable items that the user didn't buy \(items 2641 and 1573\)\.

### Using the filter expression builder<a name="using-filter-expression-builder"></a>

The **Expression builder** on the **Create filter** page provides structure, fields, and guidelines for building correctly formatted filter 

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/images/expression-builder-empty.png)

To build a filter expression:
+ Use the **Action**, **Property**, **Operator**, and **Value** fields to create an expression\. 

  For the **Value**, enter a fixed value or, to set filter criteria when you get recommendations, enter *$* \+ a parameter name\. For example, `$GENRES`\. When you get recommendations, you'll supply the value or values to filter by\. In this example, you would provide a genre or list of genres when you get recommendations\.

  Separate multiple non\-parameter values with a comma\. You cannot add comma\-separated parameters to a filter\.
**Note**  
After you choose a **Property** \(in `dataset.field` format\), the **Property** value for any succeeding rows chained by `AND` or `OR` conditions must use the same `dataset`\.
+  Use the **\+** and **X** buttons to add or delete a row from your expression\. You can't delete the first row\. 
+  For new rows, use the `AND`, `IF`, or `OR` operators on the **AND** menu to create a chain of conditions\. 

  For `IF` conditions:
  + Each expression can contain only one `IF` item\. If you remove an IF condition, the Expression builder removes any `AND` conditions following it\.
  + You can use `IF` conditions only for expressions that filter by the `CurrentUser`\.
+  Choose the **Add expression** button to add an additional filter expression for more precise filtering, including filtering using Items and Interactions datasets\. Each expression is first evaluated independently and the result is a union of the two results\. 
**Note**  
To create a filter that uses both Item and Interaction datasets, you *must* use multiple expressions\.

#### Expression builder example<a name="expression-builder-example"></a>

The following example shows how to build a filter that excludes items with a genre that you specify when you get recommendations \(note the $GENRES placeholder parameter\)\. The filter also excludes items with a `DOWNLOAD_COUNT` of more than `200`, but only if the current user's age is greater than `17`\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/images/create-filter-expression-builder.png)

### Deleting a filter \(console\)<a name="delete-filter-console"></a>

Deleting a filter removes the filter from the list of filters for a dataset group\.

**Important**  
You can't delete a filter while a batch inference job is in progress\.

**To delete a filter \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon Personalize console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/personalize/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/personalize/home) and sign into your account\. 

1. From the **Dataset groups** list, choose the dataset group that contains the filter that you want to delete\. 

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Filters**\.

1. From the list of filters, choose the filter that you want to delete and choose **View Details**\. The filter details page appears\.

1. Choose **Delete** and confirm the deletion in the confirmation dialog box\. 

## Filtering real\-time recommendations \(AWS CLI\)<a name="filter-rt-cli"></a>

To filter recommendations using the AWS CLI, you create a filter and then apply it by specifying the filter ARN in a [GetRecommendations](API_RS_GetRecommendations.md) or [GetPersonalizedRanking](API_RS_GetPersonalizedRanking.md) request\.

**Important**  
To filter recommendations using a filter with parameters and a campaign you deployed before November 10, 2020, you must re\-deploy the campaign by using the [UpdateCampaign](API_UpdateCampaign.md) call or create a new campaign\.

### Creating a filter \(AWS CLI\)<a name="creating-filter-cli"></a>

Use the following `create-filter` operation to create a filter and specify the filter expression\. 

Replace the `Filter name` with the name of the filter, and the `Dataset group ARN` with the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the dataset group\. Replace the sample `filter-expression` with your own filter expression\. 

```
aws personalize create-filter \
  --name Filter name \
  --dataset-group-arn dataset group arn \
  --filter-expression "EXCLUDE ItemID WHERE Items.CATEGORY IN (\"$CATEGORY\")"
```

 If successful, the filter ARN is displayed\. Record it for later use\. To verify that the filter is active, use the [DescribeFilter](API_DescribeFilter.md) operation before you use the filter\. 

 For more information about the API, see [CreateFilter](API_CreateFilter.md)\. For more information about filter expressions, including examples, see [Creating filter expressions](filter-expressions.md#creating-filter-expressions)\. 

### Applying a filter \(AWS CLI\)<a name="applying-filter-cli"></a>

When you use the `get-recommendations` or `get-personalized-ranking` operations, apply a filter by passing the `filter-arn` and any filter values as parameters\. 

The following is an example of the `get-recommendations` operation\. Replace `Campaign ARN` with the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of your campaign `User ID` with the ID of the user that you are getting recommendations for, and `Filter ARN` with the ARN of your filter\. If you're getting recommendations from a recommender instead of a campaign, use `--recommender-arn` instead of `--campaign-arn` and provide the ARN for the recommender\.

If your expression has any parameters, include the `filter-values` object\. For each parameter in your filter expression, provide the parameter name \(case sensitive\) and the values\. For example, if your filter expression has a `$GENRE` parameter, provide *"GENRE"* as the key, and a genre or genres, such as `"Comedy"`, as the value\. Separate multiple values with a comma\. For example, `"\"comedy\",\"drama\",\"horror"\"`\. 

**Important**  
For filter expressions that use an `INCLUDE` element to include items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression\. For filters with expressions that use an `EXCLUDE` element to exclude items, you can omit the `filter-values`\. In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter recommendations\.

```
aws personalize-runtime get-recommendations \
  --campaign-arn Campaign ARN \
  --user-id User ID \
  --filter-arn Filter ARN \
  --filter-values '{
      "Parameter name": "\"value\"",
      "Parameter name": "\"value1\",\"value2\",\"value3\""
    }'
```

### Deleting a filter \(AWS CLI\)<a name="delete-filter-cli"></a>

 Use the following `delete-filter` operation to delete a filter\. Replace `filter ARN` with the ARN of the filter\. 

```
aws personalize delete-filter --filter-arn Filter ARN
```

## Filtering real\-time recommendations \(AWS SDKs\)<a name="filter-rt-sdk"></a>

To filter recommendations using the AWS SDKs, you create a filter and then apply it by specifying the filter ARN in a [GetRecommendations](API_RS_GetRecommendations.md) or [GetPersonalizedRanking](API_RS_GetPersonalizedRanking.md) request\.

**Important**  
To filter recommendations using a filter with parameters and a campaign you deployed before November 10, 2020, you must re\-deploy the campaign by using the [UpdateCampaign](API_UpdateCampaign.md) call or create a new campaign\.

### Creating a filter \(AWS SDKs\)<a name="creating-filter-sdk"></a>

 Create a new filter with the [CreateFilter](API_CreateFilter.md) operation\. The following code shows how to create a filter\. Specify the filter name, Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of your dataset group, and provide your filter expression\. 

------
#### [ SDK for Python \(Boto3\) ]

```
import boto3
 
personalize = boto3.client('personalize')
 
response = personalize.create_filter(
    name = 'Filter Name',
    datasetGroupArn = 'Dataset Group ARN',
    filterExpression = 'EXCLUDE ItemID WHERE Items.CATEGORY IN ($CATEGORY)'
) 
filter_arn = response["filterArn"]
print("Filter ARN: " + filter_arn)
```

                .filterExpression(filterExpression)
                .build();

        return personalizeClient.createFilter(request).filterArn();
    }
    catch(PersonalizeException e) {
        System.err.println(e.awsErrorDetails().errorMessage());
        System.exit(1);
    }
    return "";
}

    console.log("Success", response);
    return response; // For unit tests.
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error", err);
  }
};
run();
```

Record the filter ARN for later use\. To verify that the filter is active, use the [DescribeFilter](API_DescribeFilter.md) operation before using the filter\. For more information about the API, see [CreateFilter](API_CreateFilter.md)\. For more information about filter expressions, including examples, see [Creating filter expressions](filter-expressions.md#creating-filter-expressions)\.

### Applying a filter \(AWS SDKs\)<a name="applying-filter-sdk"></a>

When you use the `get_recommendations` or `get_personalized_ranking` methods, apply a filter by passing a `filterArn` and any filter values as parameters\.

The following code shows how to get filtered Amazon Personalize recommendations for a user\. Specify the ID of the user you want to get recommendations for, the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of your campaign, and the ARN of your filter\. If you're getting recommendations from a recommender instead of a campaign, use `recommenderArn` instead of `campaignArn` and provide the ARN for the recommender\. 

For `filterValues`, for each optional parameter in your filter expression, provide the parameter name \(case sensitive\) and the value or values\. For example, if your filter expression has a `$GENRES` parameter, provide *"GENRES"* as the key, and a genre or genres, such as `"\"Comedy"\"`, as the value\. For multiple values, separate each value with a comma\. For example, `"\"comedy\",\"drama\",\"horror\""`\. 

**Important**  
For filter expressions that use an `INCLUDE` element to include items, you must provide values for all parameters that are defined in the expression\. For filters with expressions that use an `EXCLUDE` element to exclude items, you can omit the `filter-values`\. In this case, Amazon Personalize doesn't use that portion of the expression to filter recommendations\.

#### [ SDK for Python \(Boto3\) ]

```
import boto3

personalize_runtime = boto3.client("personalize-runtime")

    filterValues = {
      "Parameter name": "\"value1\"",
      "Parameter name": "\"value1\",\"value2\",\"value3\""
      ....
    }
)
```

------
#### [ SDK for Java 2\.x ]

The following example uses two parameters, one with two values and one with one value\. Depending on your filter expression, modify the code to add or remove parameterName and parameterValue fields\.

```
public static void getFilteredRecs(PersonalizeRuntimeClient personalizeRuntimeClient,
                                   String campaignArn,
