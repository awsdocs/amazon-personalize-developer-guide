# Getting recommendations from a recommender<a name="domain-dsg-recommendations"></a>

 With a Domain dataset group, after you create a recommender you can use it in your application to get real\-time recommendations with the [GetRecommendations](API_RS_GetRecommendations.md) operation\. Or you can test the recommender with the Amazon Personalize console\. For more information about recommenders see [Creating recommenders](creating-recommenders.md)\. 

 If you use the Recommended for you \(ECOMMERCE\) or Top picks for you \(VIDEO\_ON\_DEMAND\) use cases, Amazon Personalize updates recommendations in real\-time based on your user's most recent activity\. For more information on recording real\-time events, see [Recording events](recording-events.md)\. 

 For all use cases except [Trending now](VIDEO_ON_DEMAND-use-cases.md#trending-now-use-case), you can specify a promotion in your request\. A *promotion* defines additional business rules that apply to a configurable subset of recommended items\. For more information see [Promoting items in recommendations \(Domain dataset group\)](promoting-items-domain-dsg.md)\.

## Getting recommendations with a recommender \(console\)<a name="get-domain-rec-console"></a>

Use your recommender to get recommendations with the Amazon Personalize console as follows\.

**Get recommendations \(console\)**

1. Open the Amazon Personalize console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/personalize/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/personalize/home) and sign in to your account\.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Dataset groups** and choose your dataset group\.

1. Navigate to **Recommenders** page by doing one of the following:
   + In the navigation pane, choose **Recommenders**
   + On the Overview page, choose the recommenders tab and choose **Get recommendations**\.

1.  On the **Recommenders** page, choose your recommender\.

1.  At the top right, choose **Test recommender**\. 

1. In **Recommendation parameters**, enter your recommendation request details based on your use case\. For information on different use case recommendation requirements, see [Choosing recommender use cases](domain-use-cases.md)\. 

    If you recorded events for a user before they logged in \(an anonymous user\), you can get recommendations for this user by providing the `sessionId` from those events instead of a `userId`\. For more information about recording events for anonymous users, see [Recording events with the PutEvents operation](recording-events.md#event-record-api)\. 

1. Optionally choose a filter to filter your recommendations\. To create a filter choose **Create new filter**\. For more information, see [Filtering recommendations and user segments](filter.md)\. If your use case includes automatic filtering \(such as filtering already purchased items for the [Recommended for you](ECOMMERCE-use-cases.md#recommended-for-you-use-case) use case\), the automatic filter is applied in addition your filter\.

1. Choose **Get recommendations**\. A table containing the userâ€™s top 25 recommended items appears\. 

## Getting recommendations with a recommender \(AWS CLI\)<a name="get-domain-rec-cli"></a>

Use the following code to get recommendations from your recommender\. Change the value of `User ID` to a user ID that is in the data that you imported\. A list of the top 10 recommended items for the user displays\. To change the number of recommended items, change the value for `numResults`\. The default is 25 items\. The maximum is 500 items\. If your recommender's use case requires an itemId instead of a userId, replace the `user-id` parameter with `item-id` and specify the item ID\. 

 If you recorded events for a user before they logged in \(an anonymous user\), you can get recommendations for this user by providing the `sessionId` from those events instead of a `userId`\. For more information about recording events for anonymous users, see [Recording events with the PutEvents operation](recording-events.md#event-record-api)\. 

```
aws personalize-runtime get-recommendations \
--recommender-arn recommender arn \
--user-id User ID \
--num-results 10
```

 To filter recommendation results, specify the filter's Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) with additional the `filter-arn` parameter\. For more information, see [Filtering recommendations and user segments](filter.md)\. If your use case includes automatic filtering \(such as filtering already purchased items for the [Recommended for you](ECOMMERCE-use-cases.md#recommended-for-you-use-case) use case\), the automatic filter is applied in addition your filter\. 

## Getting recommendations with a recommender \(AWS SDKs\)<a name="get-domain-rec-sdk"></a>

The following code shows how to get Amazon Personalize recommendations from your recommender\. Specify the ID of the user you want to get recommendations for\. Amazon Personalize returns the top recommended items for the user\. To change the number of recommended items, change the value for `numResults`\. The default is 25 items\. The maximum is 500 items\. If your recommender's use case requires an itemId, replace the `userId` parameter with `itemId` and specify the item ID\. 

 If you recorded events for a user before they logged in \(an anonymous user\), you can get recommendations for this user by providing the `sessionId` from those events instead of a `userId`\. For more information about recording events for anonymous users, see [Recording events with the PutEvents operation](recording-events.md#event-record-api)\. 

 To filter recommendation results, specify the filter's Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) with the additional the `filterArn` parameter\. For more information, see [Filtering recommendations and user segments](filter.md)\. If your use case includes automatic filtering \(such as filtering already purchased items for the [Recommended for you](ECOMMERCE-use-cases.md#recommended-for-you-use-case) use case\), the automatic filter is applied in addition your filter\.
