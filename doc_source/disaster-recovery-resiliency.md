# Resilience in Amazon Personalize<a name="disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones\. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low\-latency, high\-throughput, and highly redundant networking\. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between zones without interruption\. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures\. 

 Amazon Personalize leverages the AWS global infrastructure for data resiliency\. When you create an Amazon Personalize resource in an AWS Region, Amazon Personalize manages the resilience and data redundancy of the resource across multiple Availability Zones\. For a list of AWS regions where you can create Amazon Personalize resources, see [AWS regions and endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/personalize.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\. For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS global infrastructure](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/)\.
