# Tagging Amazon Personalize resources<a name="tagging-resources"></a>

A *tag* is a label that you optionally define and associate with AWS resources, including certain types of Amazon Personalize resources\. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, environment, or other criteria\. For example, you can use tags to split revenue between different functions, or identify development environments for different resources\. A resource can have as many as 50 tags\. 

**Note**  
You can't use tag\-based authorization in AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) policies to control a user's access to Amazon Personalize resources\.

You can add tags to the following types of Amazon Personalize resources: 
+  Batch inference jobs 
+  Batch segment jobs 
+ Campaigns
+ Datasets
+ Dataset groups
+ Dataset import and export jobs
+ Event trackers
+ Filters
+ Recommenders
