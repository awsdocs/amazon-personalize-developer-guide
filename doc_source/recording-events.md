# Recording events<a name="recording-events"></a>

 With both Domain dataset group and Custom dataset group, Amazon Personalize can make recommendations based on real\-time *[event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#event)* data only, historical event data only \(see [Importing bulk records](bulk-data-import.md)\), or a mixture of both\. Record events in real\-time so Amazon Personalize can learn from your userâ€™s most recent activity and update recommendations as they use your application\. This keeps your interactions data fresh and improves the relevance of Amazon Personalize recommendations\. 

 You can record real\-time events using the AWS SDKs, AWS Amplify or AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. When you record events, Amazon Personalize appends the event data to the Interactions dataset in your dataset group\. If you record two events with exactly the same timestamp and identical properties, Amazon Personalize keeps only one of the events\.

 AWS Amplify includes a JavaScript library for recording events from web client applications, and a library for recording events in server code\. For more information, see [Amplify \- analytics](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/analytics)\.

## Requirements for recording events and training a model<a name="recording-events-requirements"></a>

To record events, you need the following:
+ A dataset group that includes an `Interactions` dataset, which can be empty\. If you went through the [Getting started](getting-started.md) guide, you can use the same dataset group and dataset that you created\. For information on creating a dataset group and a dataset, see [Preparing and importing data](data-prep.md)\.
+ An event tracker
+ A call to the [PutEvents](API_UBS_PutEvents.md) operation\.

You can start out with an empty Interactions dataset and, when you have recorded enough data, train the model using only new recorded events\. For all use cases \(Domain dataset groups\) and recipes \(Custom dataset groups\), your interactions data must have the following before training: 
+ At minimum 1000 interactions records from users interacting with items in your catalog\. These interactions can be from bulk imports, or streamed events, or both\.
+ At minimum 25 unique user IDs with at least 2 interactions for each\.

## How real\-time events influence recommendations<a name="recorded-events-influence-recommendations"></a>

 Once you create a campaign \(for custom solutions\) or a recommender \(for Domain dataset group\), Amazon Personalize automatically uses new recorded event data for existing items \(items you included in the data you used to train the latest model or create the latest recommender\) when generating recommendations\. This does not require retraining the model \(unless you are using the SIMS or Popularity\-Count recipes for custom solutions\)\. 

Instead, Amazon Personalize adds the new recorded event data to the user's history\. Amazon Personalize then uses the modified data when generating recommendations for the user \(and this user only\)\.
+  For recorded events for *new items* \(items you did not include in the data you used to train the model\), if you created recommenders for *Top picks for you* and *Recommended for you* use cases \(for Domain dataset group\) or if you trained your model \(solution version\) with User\-Personalization, Amazon Personalize automatically updates the model every two hours\. After each update completes, the new items influence recommendations\. For information about auto updates for the User\-Personalization recipe, see [User\-Personalization recipe](native-recipe-new-item-USER_PERSONALIZATION.md)\. 

   For any other domain use case, Amazon Personalize will automatically train new models for your recommenders every 7 days, starting from the recommender creation date\. For any other custom recipe, you must re\-train the model for the new records to influence recommendations\. Amazon Personalize stores recorded events for new items and, once you create a new solution version \(train a new model\), this new data will influence Amazon Personalize recommendations for the user\. 
+  For recorded events for *new users* \(users that were not included in the data you used to create recommenders or solution versions\), recommendations will initially be for popular items\. If you provide have metadata about the user in a Users dataset and you choose a recipe that uses metadata, such as User\-Personalization or Personalized\-Ranking, these popular items will be more relevant for the user\. 

   Recommendations will become more relevant as you record more events for the user\. Amazon Personalize stores the new user data and will use it for training when Amazon Personalize performs automatic updates, or when you manually train a new solution version\. 

   For new, anonymous users \(users without a userId\), Amazon Personalize uses the `sessionId` you pass in the [PutEvents](API_UBS_PutEvents.md) operation to associate events with the user before they log in\. For more information see [Recording events for anonymous users](#recording-anonymous-user-events) 

 The following recipes and use cases support real\-time updates to recommendations, where recommendations for a user update as you record their interactions with items: 
+ User\-Personalization recipe
+ Personalized\-Ranking recipe
+ Recommended for you \(ECOMMERCE use case\)
+ Top picks for you \(VIDEO\_ON\_DEMAND use case\)

## Creating an event tracker<a name="event-get-tracker"></a>

An *[event tracker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#event-tracker)* specifies a destination dataset group for new event data\. You create an event tracker with the Amazon Personalize console or the [CreateEventTracker](API_CreateEventTracker.md) API operation\. You pass as a parameter the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the dataset group that contains the target Interactions dataset\. For instructions on creating an event tracker using the Amazon Personalize console, see [Creating an event tracker \(console\)](importing-interactions.md#event-tracker-console)\. 

 An event tracker includes a *tracking ID*, which you pass as a parameter when you use the [PutEvents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html) operation\. Amazon Personalize then appends the new event data to the Interactions dataset of the dataset group you specify in your event tracker\. 

**Note**  
You can create only one event tracker for a dataset group\.

------
#### [ Python ]

```
import boto3

personalize = boto3.client('personalize')

response = personalize.create_event_tracker(
    name='MovieClickTracker',
    datasetGroupArn='arn:aws:personalize:us-west-2:acct-id:dataset-group/MovieClickGroup'
)
print(response['eventTrackerArn'])
print(response['trackingId'])
```

The event tracker ARN and tracking ID display, for example:

```
{
    "eventTrackerArn": "arn:aws:personalize:us-west-2:acct-id:event-tracker/MovieClickTracker",
    "trackingId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

```
aws personalize create-event-tracker \
    --name MovieClickTracker \
    --dataset-group-arn arn:aws:personalize:us-west-2:acct-id:dataset-group/MovieClickGroup
```

The event tracker ARN and tracking ID display, for example:

```
{
    "eventTrackerArn": "arn:aws:personalize:us-west-2:acct-id:event-tracker/MovieClickTracker",
    "trackingId": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

public static String createEventTracker(PersonalizeClient personalizeClient, 
                                      String eventTrackerName,

## Recording events with the PutEvents operation<a name="event-record-api"></a>

To record events, you call the [PutEvents](API_UBS_PutEvents.md) operation\. The following example shows a `PutEvents` operation that passes one event\. The corresponding Interactions schema is shown, along with an example row from the Interactions dataset\.

Your application generates the `sessionId` when a user first visits your website or uses your application\. Amazon Personalize uses the `sessionId` to associate events with the user before they log in \(is anonymous\)\. For more information see [Recording events for anonymous users](#recording-anonymous-user-events)\.

The event list is an array of [Event](API_UBS_Event.md) objects\. An `eventType` is required for each event, but in this example, `eventType` data is not used in training because it is not included in the schema\. You can provide a placeholder value to satisfy the requirement\. 

The `userId`, `itemId`, and `sentAt` parameters map to the USER\_ID, ITEM\_ID, and TIMESTAMP fields of a corresponding historical `Interactions` dataset\. For more information, see [Datasets and schemas](how-it-works-dataset-schema.md)\.

**Corresponding interactions schema**

```
Interactions schema: USER_ID, ITEM_ID, TIMESTAMP
Interactions dataset: user123, item-xyz, 1543631760
```

**Code example**

------
#### [ Python ]

```
import boto3

personalize_events = boto3.client(service_name='personalize-events')

personalize_events.put_events(
    trackingId = 'tracking_id',
    userId= 'USER_ID',
    sessionId = 'session_id',
    eventList = [{
        'sentAt': TIMESTAMP,
        'eventType': 'eventTypePlaceholder',
        'itemId': 'ITEM_ID'
        }]
)
```

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

```
aws personalize-events put-events \
    --tracking-id tracking_id \
    --user-id USER_ID \
    --session-id session_id \
    --event-list '[{
        "sentAt": "TIMESTAMP",
        "eventType": "eventTypePlaceholder",
        "itemId": "ITEM_ID"
      }]'
```

------
#### [ SDK for Java 2\.x ]

```
public static void putEvents(PersonalizeEventsClient personalizeEventsClient, 
                            String trackingId, 
                            String sessionId, 
                            String userId, 
                            String itemId) {
    
    try { 
        Event event = Event.builder()
            .sentAt(Instant.ofEpochMilli(System.currentTimeMillis() + 10 * 60 * 1000))
            .itemId(itemId)
            .eventType("typePlaceholder")
            .build();

        PutEventsRequest putEventsRequest = PutEventsRequest.builder()
            .trackingId(trackingId)
            .userId(userId)
            .sessionId(sessionId)
            .eventList(event)
            .build();

        int responseCode = personalizeEventsClient.putEvents(putEventsRequest)
            .sdkHttpResponse()
            .statusCode();
        System.out.println("Response code: " + responseCode);

        } catch (PersonalizeEventsException e) {
            System.out.println(e.awsErrorDetails().errorMessage());
        }
}
```

------

After this example, you would proceed to train a model using only the required properties\.

The next example shows how to submit data that would train on the event value\. It also demonstrates the passing of multiple events of different types \('like' and 'rating'\)\. In this case, you must specify the event type to train on in the [CreateSolution](API_CreateSolution.md) operation \(see **Events and Solutions** below\)\. The example also shows the recording of an extra property, `numRatings`, that is used as metadata by certain recipes\.

```
Interactions schema: USER_ID, ITEM_ID, TIMESTAMP, EVENT_TYPE, EVENT_VALUE, NUM_RATINGS
Interactions dataset: user123, movie_xyz, 1543531139, rating, 5, 12
                      user321, choc-ghana, 1543531760, like, 4
                      user111, choc-fake, 1543557118, like, 3

}
```

------

**Note**  
The properties keys use camel case names that match the fields in the Interactions schema\. For example, if the field 'NUM\_RATINGS' is defined in the Interactions schema, the property key should be `numRatings`\.

## Recording events for anonymous users<a name="recording-anonymous-user-events"></a>

You can record events for users before they create an account\. This allows you to get recommendations for anonymous users\. You can provide the `sessionId` as the `userID` in your [GetRecommendations](API_RS_GetRecommendations.md) request\.

 Record events for anonymous users to build a continuous event history with events from before and after they log in\. This provides Amazon Personalize more interactions data about the user, which can help generate more relevant recommendations\. 

 To build a continuous event history for a user, record at minimum one event with the `sessionId` from the anonymous events and their new `userId`\. Then you can record any number of events for the `userId`\. The `sessionId` can change\. During the next full retraining, Amazon Personalize associates the `userId` with the event history tracked to the `sessionId`\. Retraining can either be the next time you create a new solution version with training mode set to FULL \(Custom dataset groups\), or the next automatic retraining for recommenders \(Domain dataset groups\)\. 

 After retraining completes, recommendations will be based on activity tracked to both the sessionId from anonymous sessions and any events tracked to their userId\. 

## Recording impressions data<a name="putevents-including-impressions-data"></a>

If you use the [User\-Personalization](native-recipe-new-item-USER_PERSONALIZATION.md) recipe or add the IMPRESSIONS field to your schema for a dataset in a Domain dataset group, you can record impressions data in your PutEvents operation\. Impressions are lists of items that were visible to a user when they interacted with \(for example, clicked or watched\) a particular item\. Amazon Personalize uses impressions data to guide exploration, where recommendations include items with less interactions data or relevance\. For information on the *implicit* and *explicit* impressions Amazon Personalize can model, see [Impressions data](interactions-datasets.md#interactions-impressions-data)\. 

**Important**  
If you provide conflicting implicit and explicit impression data in your `PutEvents` requests, Amazon Personalize uses the explicit impressions by default\.

To record the Amazon Personalize recommendations you show your user as impressions data, include the `recommendationId` in your [PutEvents](API_UBS_PutEvents.md) request and Amazon Personalize derives the implicit impressions based on your recommendation data\.

To manually record impressions data for an event, list the impressions in the [PutEvents](API_UBS_PutEvents.md) command's `impression` input parameter\. The following code sample shows how to include a `recommendationId` and an `impression` in a PutEvents operation with either the SDK for Python \(Boto3\) or the SDK for Java 2\.x\. If you include both, Amazon Personalize uses the explicit impressions by default\.

------
#### [ SDK for Python \(Boto3\) ]

```
import boto3

personalize_events = boto3.client(service_name='personalize-events')

personalize_events.put_events(
    trackingId = 'tracking_id',
    userId= 'userId',
    sessionId = 'sessionId',
    eventList = [{
        'eventId': 'event1',
        'eventType': 'rating',
        'sentAt': 1553631760,
        'itemId': 'item id',
        'recommendationId': 'recommendation id',
        'impression': ['itemId1', 'itemId2', 'itemId3']
        }]
)
```

------
#### [ SDK for Java 2\.x ]

Use the following `putEvents` method to record an event with impressions data and a recommendationId\. For the impressions parameter, pass the list of itemIds as an ArrayList\.

```
public static void putEvents(PersonalizeEventsClient personalizeEventsClient, 
                                String trackingId, 
                                String sessionId, 
                                String userId, 
                                String eventType, 
                                Float eventValue, 
                                String itemId,
                                ArrayList<String> impressions,
                                String recommendationId) {

    try { 
        Event event = Event.builder()
            .eventType(eventType)
            .sentAt(Instant.ofEpochMilli(System.currentTimeMillis() + 10 * 60 * 1000))
            .itemId(itemId)
            .eventValue(eventValue)
            .impression(impressions)
            .recommendationId(recommendationId)
            .build();

        PutEventsRequest putEventsRequest = PutEventsRequest.builder()
            .trackingId(trackingId)
            .userId(userId)
            .sessionId(sessionId)
            .eventList(event)
            .build();

        int responseCode = personalizeEventsClient.putEvents(putEventsRequest)
            .sdkHttpResponse()
            .statusCode();
        System.out.println("Response code: " + responseCode);

    } catch (PersonalizeEventsException e) {
        System.out.println(e.awsErrorDetails().errorMessage());
    }
}
```

## Event metrics and attribution reports<a name="event-metrics"></a>

To monitor the type and number of events sent to Amazon Personalize, use Amazon CloudWatch metrics\. For more information, see [Monitoring Amazon Personalize](personalize-monitoring.md)\. 

 To generate CloudWatch reports that show the impact of recommendations, create a metric attribution and record user interactions with real\-time recommendations\. For information on creating a metric attribution, see [Measuring impact of recommendations](measuring-recommendation-impact.md)\. 

 For each event, include recommendation ID of the recommendations you showed the user\. Or include the event source, such as a third party\. Import this data to compare different campaigns, recommenders, and third parties\. You can import at most 100 event attribution sources\. 
+  If you provide a `recommendationId`, Amazon Personalize automatically determines the source campaign or recommender and identifies it in reports in an EVENT\_ATTRIBUTION\_SOURCE column\. 
+  If you provide both attributes, Amazon Personalize uses only the `eventAttributionSource`\. 
+  If you don't provide a source, Amazon Personalize labels the source `SOURCE_NAME_UNDEFINED` in reports\. 

 The following code shows how to provide an `eventAttributionSource` for an event in a PutEvents operation\. 

```
response = personalize_events.put_events(
    trackingId = 'eventTrackerId',
    userId= 'userId',
    sessionId = 'sessionId123',
    eventList = [{
        'eventId': 'event1',
        'eventType': 'watch',
        'sentAt': '1667260945',
        'itemId': '123',
        'metricAttribution': { 
            'eventAttributionSource': 'thirdPartyServiceXYZ'
        }
    }]
)
statusCode = response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode']
print(statusCode)
```
