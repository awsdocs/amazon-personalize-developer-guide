## Requesting a quota increase<a name="requesting-limit-increase"></a>

 For adjustable quotas, you can request a quota increase using the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/)\. The following Amazon Personalize quotas are adjustable: 
+  Total number of active campaigns 
+  Maximum number of filters per account 
+  Total number of pending or in progress batch inference jobs 
+  Total number of pending or in progress solution versions 
+  Maximum rate of `PutEvents` requests 

 To request a quota increase, use the [Service Quotas console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/) and follow the steps in the [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) section of the *Service Quotas User Guide*\.
