# Getting started \(SDK for Python \(Boto3\)\)<a name="getting-started-python"></a>

This topic explains how to get started programming Amazon Personalize with the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\)\.

## Prerequisites<a name="gs-sdk-prerequisites"></a>

The following are prerequisite steps for using the Python examples in this guide:
+ Complete the [Getting started prerequisites](gs-prerequisites.md)\. You create the training data used in this tutorial when you complete the prerequisite steps\. If you are using your own source data, make sure your data is formatted like in the prerequisite step [Creating the training data \(Custom dataset group\)](gs-prerequisites.md#gs-upload-to-bucket)\.
+ Set up your AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\) environment, as specified in [Setting up the AWS SDKs](aws-personalize-set-up-sdks.md)\.

When you finish the getting started exercise, to avoid incurring unnecessary charges, follow the steps in [Cleaning up resources](gs-cleanup.md) to delete the resources you created\. 

## Step 1: Verify your Python environment<a name="gs-python-example"></a>

After you complete the prerequisites, run the following Python example to confirm that your environment is configured correctly\. If your environment is configured correctly, a list of the available recipes is displayed and you can run the other Python examples in this guide\. 

```
import boto3

personalize = boto3.client('personalize')

response = personalize.list_recipes()

for recipe in response['recipes']:
    print (recipe)
```

## Step 2: Import training data<a name="getting-started-python-import-dataset"></a>

After you verify that your Python environment is configured correctly, import your data\. To use a dataset for training, you need to do the following:

1. Add a schema\. The schema allows Amazon Personalize to parse the training dataset\. For a code sample, see [Creating a schema with SDK for Python \(Boto3\)](python-schema-ex.md)\.

1. Import the data\. You create a dataset group which contains one or several datasets that Amazon Personalize can use for training\. For a code sample, see [Importing bulk records \(AWS SDKs\)](bulk-data-import-step.md#python-import-ex)\.

1. \(Optional\) Add an event tracker\. To record interactions events, you must add a tracking ID to associate the event with your dataset group\. For a code sample, see [Creating an event tracker](recording-events.md#event-get-tracker)\.

1. \(Optional\) Add an event record\. To add more data in training and create a better model, you can use events\. Events are recorded user activities such as a search, a view, or a purchase\. For a code sample, see [PutEvents operation](recording-events.md#event-record-api)\.

## Step 3: Create a solution<a name="getting-started-python-create-solution"></a>

After you import your data, create a solution and solution version\. The *solution* contains the configurations to train a model\. A *solution version* is a trained model\. For more information, see [Creating a solution](training-deploying-solutions.md)\.

When you create a solution version, evaluate its performance before proceeding\. For a code sample, see [Step 4: Evaluating a solution version with metrics](working-with-training-metrics.md)\.

## Step 4: Create a campaign<a name="getting-started-python-deploy-solution"></a>

After you train and evaluate your solution version, you can deploy it using a campaign\. A campaign is an endpoint used to host a solution version and make recommendations to users\. For a code sample, see [Creating a campaign](campaigns.md)\.

## Step 5: Get recommendations<a name="getting-started-python-get-recommendations"></a>

After you create a campaign, you can use it to get recommendations\. For a code sample, see [Getting recommendations](recommendations.md)\.

## Getting started using Amazon Personalize APIs with Jupyter \(iPython\) notebooks<a name="gs-jupyter-notebook"></a>

 To get started using Amazon Personalize using Jupyter notebooks, clone or download a series of notebooks found in the [getting\_started](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples/tree/master/getting_started) folder of the [Amazon Personalize samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples) repository\. The notebooks walk you through importing training data, creating a solution, creating a campaign, and getting recommendations using Amazon Personalize\.

**Note**  
 Before starting with the notebooks, make sure to build your environment following the steps in the [README\.md](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples/blob/master/getting_started/README.md)
