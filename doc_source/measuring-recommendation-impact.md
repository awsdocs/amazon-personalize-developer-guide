# Measuring impact of recommendations<a name="measuring-recommendation-impact"></a>

 As your customers interact with recommendations, you can measure how the recommendations are helping you achieve your goals\. You can identify which campaigns and recommenders have the most impact, such as the most revenue or clicks\. And you can compare the performance of Amazon Personalize recommendations to those generated by third\-party services\. 

 To measure the impact of recommendations, you create a metric attribution\. A *metric attribution* creates reports based on the interactions and items data that you import, and the metrics that you specify\. For example, the total revenue from click events or the total number or purchases\. Amazon Personalize aggregates calculations over a 15\-minute window\. For PutEvents data and incremental bulk data, Amazon Personalize automatically sends metric reports to Amazon CloudWatch\. For bulk data, you can choose to publish reports to an Amazon S3 bucket\. 

 For each interaction you import, include the recommendation ID of the recommendations you showed the user\. Or include the event source, such as a third party\. Import this data to compare different campaigns, recommenders, and third parties\.

 For example, you might have an ecommerce app that shows item recommendations from two different Amazon Personalize recommenders\. If you wanted to see which recommender generates the most revenue over time, you could create a metric attribution that tracks the total revenue from purchase events\. Then you could record purchase events as users interact with recommendations, and include the `recommendationId` in each event\. Amazon Personalize uses the `recommendationId` to identify each recommender\. As you record events, you can view the revenue totals aggregated over every 15 minutes for both recommenders in CloudWatch\. For code samples that show how to include a `recommendationId` or an `eventAttributionSource`, see [Event metrics and attribution reports](recording-events.md#event-metrics)\.
