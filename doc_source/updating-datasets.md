# Updating data<a name="updating-datasets"></a>

After you import data into an Amazon Personalize dataset, you can update it with bulk or individual data import operations\. You can't make changes to the schema for the dataset\. If you need to make changes to your schema, such as adding or removing an attribute, you must delete your dataset\. Then you must create a new dataset with a new schema and import data again\.
