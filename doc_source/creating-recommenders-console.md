# Creating recommenders \(console\)<a name="creating-recommenders-console"></a>

 Create recommenders for each of your use cases with the Amazon Personalize console as follows\. 

**Note**  
If you just created your Domain dataset group and you are already on the **Overview** page, skip to step 3\.

**To create recommenders**

1. Open the Amazon Personalize console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/personalize/home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/personalize/home) and sign in to your account\.

1.  On the **Dataset groups** page, choose your Domain dataset group\. 

1.  On the **Use <domain name> recommenders** tab of the middle card choose **Create recommenders**\. 

1. On the **Create recommenders** page, choose the use cases you want to create recommenders and give each a **Recommender name**\. Amazon Personalize creates a recommender for each use case that you choose\. The available use cases depend on your domain\. For information on choosing a use case see [Choosing recommender use cases](domain-use-cases.md)\.

1. To make changes to your recommender configuration, optionally toggle **Use default recommender configurations** to modify the following:
   + Optionally make any changes to the recommender's **Minimum recommendation requests per second**\. For more information see [Minimum recommendation requests per second and auto\-scaling](creating-recommenders.md#min-rrps-auto-scaling)\.
   + For `Top picks for your` or `Recommended for you` use cases, optionally make changes to exploration configuration\. Exploration is the process that Amazon Personalize uses to test different item recommendations and learn how users respond to new items with no or very little interaction data\. Use the following fields to configure exploration: 
     + Emphasis on exploring less relevant items: Configure how much to explore, where recommendations include items with less interactions data or relevance more frequently the more exploration you specify\. The closer the value is to 1, the more exploration\. At zero, no exploration occurs and recommendations are based on current data \(relevance\)\.
     + Exploration item age cut off: Enter the maximum item age, in days since the latest interaction, to define the scope of item exploration\. To increase the number of items Amazon Personalize considers during exploration, enter a greater value\. 

        For example, if you enter 10, only items with interactions data from the 10 days since the latest interaction in the dataset are considered during exploration\. 
**Note**  
Recommendations might include items without interactions data from outside this time frame\. This is because these items are relevant to the user's interests, and exploration wasn't required to identify them\.

1. Choose **Create recommenders** to create recommenders for each of your use cases\.

   You can monitor the status of each recommender on the **Recommenders** page\. When your recommender status is Active, you can use it in your application to get recommendations\.
