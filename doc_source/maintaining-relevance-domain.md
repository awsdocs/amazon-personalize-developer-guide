# Maintaining recommendation relevance \(Domain dataset group\)<a name="maintaining-relevance-domain"></a>

 Maintain the relevance of recommendations to increase user engagement, click\-through rate, and conversion rate for your application as your catalogue grows\. To maintain and improve the relevance of Amazon Personalize recommendations for your users, keep your data in Amazon Personalize up to date\. This allows Amazon Personalize to learn from your userâ€™s most recent behavior and include your newest items in recommendations\. 

 For users and items, as your catalog grows, update your historical data with bulk or individual data import operations\. We recommend that you first import your records in bulk, and then add individual items and users as your catalog grows\. For information on managing item and user data, see [Managing data](managing-domain-dsg-data.md)\.

For real\-time recommendations with the Recommended for you \(ECOMMERCE\) or Top picks for you \(VIDEO\_ON\_DEMAND\) use cases, improve recommendation relevance for your users by recording interaction *[events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/glos-chap.html#event)* with an event tracker and the [PutEvents](API_UBS_PutEvents.md) operation\. Amazon Personalize updates recommendations based on your user's most recent activity as they interact with your application\. For more information on recording events, see [Recording events](recording-events.md)\. 

New records influence recommendations as follows:
+  For *new events*, Amazon Personalize immediately uses real\-time interaction events between a user and existing items \(items you included in the data you used to train the latest model\) when generating recommendations for the same user\. For more information, see [How real\-time events influence recommendations](recording-events.md#recorded-events-influence-recommendations)\. 
+ For *new items*, if you create the recommender with *Top picks for you* and *Recommended for you* and the recommender is active, Amazon Personalize automatically updates the underlying models every two hours\. After each update, the new items might be included in recommendations\. 

  For any other domain use case, Amazon Personalize automatically trains new models for your recommenders every 7 days, starting from the recommender creation date\.
+ For *new users* without interactions data, recommendations are initially for only popular items\. If you have metadata about the user in a Users dataset and you choose a use case that uses metadata, like Top picks for you \(VIDEO\_ON\_DEMAND\) or Recommended for you \(ECOMMERCE\), use the metadata and any contextual metadata you provide to improve the relevance of these popular items\. 

   To get more relevant recommendations for the user, you can import bulk interactions data for the user and wait for the next model update\. Or you can record events for the user as they interact with items\. Their recommendations will be more relevant as you record more events\. For more information, see [Recording events](recording-events.md)\.
