# Giving Amazon Personalize access to Amazon S3 resources<a name="granting-personalize-s3-access"></a>

To give Amazon Personalize access to your Amazon S3 bucket, do the following:

1. If you haven't already, follow the steps in [Setting up permissions](aws-personalize-set-up-permissions.md) to set up permissions so your IAM users can access Amazon Personalize and Amazon Personalize can access your resources\.

1.  Attach a policy to the Amazon Personalize service role \(see [Creating an IAM role for Amazon Personalize](aws-personalize-set-up-permissions.md#set-up-create-role-with-permissions)\) that allows access to your Amazon S3 bucket\. For more information, see [Attaching an Amazon S3 policy to your Amazon Personalize service role](#attaching-s3-policy-to-role)\. 

1.  Attach a bucket policy to the Amazon S3 bucket containing your data files so Amazon Personalize can access them\. For more information, see [Attaching an Amazon Personalize access policy to your Amazon S3 bucket](#attach-bucket-policy)\. 

1. If you are using AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) for encryption, you must give your IAM user and Amazon Personalize IAM service role permission to use your key\. You must also add Amazon Personalize as a Principle in your AWS KMS key policy\. For more information see [Using key policies in AWS KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

**Note**  
Because Amazon Personalize doesnâ€™t communicate with AWS VPCs, Amazon Personalize can't interact with Amazon S3 buckets that allow only VPC access\.

       "Id": "PersonalizeS3BucketAccessPolicy",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PersonalizeS3BucketAccessPolicy",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "s3:GetObject",

                   "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name",
                   "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

1. Choose **Next: Tags**\. Optionally add any tags and choose **Review**\.

1. Give the policy a name\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Description**, enter a short sentence describing this policy, for example, **Allow Amazon Personalize to access its Amazon S3 bucket\.**

1. Choose **Create policy**\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, and choose the role you created for Amazon Personalize\. See [Creating an IAM role for Amazon Personalize](aws-personalize-set-up-permissions.md#set-up-create-role-with-permissions)\.

1. For **Permissions**, choose **Attach policies**\.

1. To display the policy in the list, type part of the policy name in the **Filter policies** filter box\.

1. Choose the check box next to the policy you created earlier in this procedure\.

1. Choose **Attach policy**\.

   Before your role is ready for use with Amazon Personalize you must also attach a bucket policy to the Amazon S3 bucket containing your data\. See [Attaching an Amazon Personalize access policy to your Amazon S3 bucket](#attach-bucket-policy)\.
