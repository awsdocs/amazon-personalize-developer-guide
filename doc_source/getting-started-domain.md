# Getting started with a Domain dataset group<a name="getting-started-domain"></a>

 In this getting started tutorial you create a Domain dataset group for the VIDEO\_ON\_DEMAND domain, import interactions data from a CSV file, and create a recommender with the *Top picks for you* use case\. Then you use the recommender to get personalized movie recommendations for a user\. The tutorial uses historical data that consists of 100,000 movie ratings on 9,700 movies from 600 users\. 

To begin, complete the [Getting started prerequisites](gs-prerequisites.md) and then depending on how you want to create Amazon Personalize resources, proceed to either [Getting started with a Domain dataset group \(console\)](getting-started-console-domain.md), [Getting started with a Domain dataset group \(SDK for Python \(Boto3\)\)](getting-started-domain-python.md), or [Getting started with a Domain dataset group \(SDK for Java 2\.x\)](domain-getting-started-java.md)\.

When you finish the getting started exercise, to avoid incurring unnecessary charges, follow the steps in [Cleaning up resources](gs-cleanup.md) to delete the resources you created\.
