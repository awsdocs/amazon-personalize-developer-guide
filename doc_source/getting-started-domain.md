# Getting started with a Domain dataset group<a name="getting-started-domain"></a>

 This getting started guide shows you how to create a Domain dataset group and domain resources with the Amazon Personalize console\. You create Domain dataset group for the VIDEO\_ON\_DEMAND domain, import interactions data, and create and use recommenders for VIDEO\_ON\_DEMAND use cases to get personalized movie recommendations\. 

 For information on using the AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\) see [Getting started with a Domain dataset group \(SDK for Python \(Boto3\)\)](#gs-python-domain)\.

 To get started creating Domain dataset groups with Jupyter notebooks, clone or download a series of notebooks found in the [notebooks\_managed\_domains](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples/tree/master/getting_started/notebooks_managed_domains) folder of the [Amazon Personalize samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples) repository\. The notebooks walk you through importing training data, creating a recommender, and getting recommendations with Amazon Personalize\.

**Note**  
 Before starting with the notebooks, make sure to build your environment following the steps in the [README\.md](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-personalize-samples/blob/master/getting_started/README.md)
