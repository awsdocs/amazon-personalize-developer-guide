# Choosing recommender use cases<a name="domain-use-cases"></a>

 Each domain has different use cases\. When you create a recommender, you create it for a specific use case\. Each use case has different requirements for getting recommendations\. 

 For all use cases, your interactions data must have the following: 
+ At minimum 1000 interactions records from users interacting with items in your catalog\. These interactions can be from bulk imports, or streamed events, or both\.
+ At minimum 25 unique user IDs with at least 2 interactions for each\.
